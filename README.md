AI Agent Orchestration Using Microsoft Copilot Studio
🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the development and testing of Single Agent, Multi-Child Agent, and Multi-Parent Agent orchestration systems using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
The goal is to automate tasks such as query generation, SQL validation, execution, and visualization-driven insights.

As a Data Scientist Intern, I contributed to designing workflows, testing agent performance, and improving reliability across all orchestration levels.

🔧 Project Features
1️⃣ Single Agent Orchestration

Handles end-to-end query understanding and response generation

Manages simple workflows independently

Acts as the base framework for multi-agent expansion

2️⃣ Multi-Child Agent Orchestration

Breaks tasks into specialized child agents (Query Generator, SQL Validator, Executor, Insight Generator, etc.)

Allows parallel task handling and better modularity

Improves accuracy through specialization

3️⃣ Multi-Parent Agent Orchestration

Multiple parent agents control and coordinate groups of child agents

Ensures workflow scalability for complex business processes

Enables independent decision units working together

🧠 My Contributions
